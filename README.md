# Food-Item-Categorization

The abundance of food-related data available in various digital formats presents a unique opportunity for analysis and insight generation. However, the sheer volume and diversity of food items pose a significant challenge for effective data mining and analysis. This project aims to develop an automated system for categorizing food items based on their attributes, leveraging natural language processing and machine learning techniques, and data mining algorithms.

For instance,

Idli - South Indian, Protein Rich, Breakfast, Baked Items etc.

Ragi Dosa - South Indian, Diabetic Friendly, Millet Based, Pregnancy friendly
